# Hello, I'm Timur 👋

I'm an iOS developer passionate about creating intuitive, user-friendly apps. I specialize in building apps that make life easier and more enjoyable.

## 🚀 Technologies & Skills

Here are the tools I use to bring ideas to life:

- **iOS Development**: Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit

- **Concurrency**: Swift Concurrency, Async/Await
- **Networking**: REST APIs, JSON
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
